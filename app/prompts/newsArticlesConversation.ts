<newsArticle1> In November, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft experienced a communication interruption that caused concern among its mission controllers. Despite the lack of data transmission, the spacecraft was still responsive to commands. After some investigation, the team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory identified that a malfunctioning chip was at the root of the problem, preventing access to essential parts of the spacecraft's memory. To address this, engineers devised a workaround by redistributing the affected code across different memory sections and updating the internal references. This solution was implemented in April 2024, and the spacecraft, now over 15 billion miles from Earth, successfully resumed sending back health and status data. Voyager 1 continues to study cosmic phenomena but is expected to cease operations and exit the Deep Space Network by 2036. </newsArticle1> 
<newsArticle2>Nineteen-year-old Lloyd Martin has set a new record as the youngest person with Down Syndrome to complete the London Marathon. Celebrating at the finish line, Lloyd received a Guinness World Records plaque and marked the occasion with enthusiastic dance moves. He impressively ran the first 14 miles without stopping, a personal best, and then alternated between walking and jogging for the remainder of the 26.4-mile course. His achievement was supported by his mother, Ceri Hooper, a former international track and field athlete for Wales, who provided extensive training and motivation. Lloyd's preparation included building strength and stamina through 5k races. His participation was facilitated by the Special Olympics organization for Great Britain, making him the youngest finisher in the intellectual impairment category of the marathon.</newsArticle2>
<newsArticle3>DonnaJean Wilde from Alberta has set a new world record for the longest abdominal plank, holding the position for 4 hours, 30 minutes, and 11 seconds. This achievement surpassed the previous record held by another Albertan named Dana. DonnaJean began using the plank exercise as a rehabilitation method after breaking her wrist about a decade ago and discovering it was effective for maintaining her fitness without straining her injury. Her family describes her exceptional dedication to fitness; she even planked while watching movies and studying for her master's degree. Despite suffering from transverse myelitis, a condition causing pain and numbness in the arms, hands, and shoulders, DonnaJean has adapted to manage the discomfort, which she credits as helping her endure the physical challenge of long-duration planking. Her record-setting effort is described as a dream come true.</newsArticle3>
